# OthelloWar

The main class is called "OthelloWar.java"
It takes command line arugments to choose what stage you wish to play on.

The make file is titles "OWMF"
By default,
	 running make -f OWMF 
will compile the it and run a 2 Player game

I've never used git or done a README before so this is all I'm going to put.
