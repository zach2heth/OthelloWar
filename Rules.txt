Overview
    The main mechanic of the game works similar to Othello, where a block
    is placed and all blocks between two that are the same color, will change
    into that color. However, in this game, not only do enemy pieces convert colors
    but neutral blocks can change colors.
    This game also has units which move along those blocks.
Objective
    Move a unit onto one of the opponent's ObjectiveBlocks.
PlayerTurn
    There are three different actions that can be taken in any order
    1)Place a CB
        A CB can only be placed if it will result in a CC of at least one block
    2)Move Units
        All units can move and take an action once a turn
    3)Move a GuardBlock
        Only one GuardBlock can be moved per turn
    At the end of a turn, the player must decide what kind of unit will
    will be created on the SB at the start of their next turn.
Definitions/Rules
  NeutralBlock (NeB)
      Blocks with no assigned color. Cannot be crossed by any units.
  ColorBlock (CB)
      A block with a specified color that represents a player.
  Color Change (CC)
      When a CB is placed, if there exists a CB in the same row or column
      all NeBs and CBs between the same colored CB's will change to that color.
      If there are multiple CB's of the same color in the same row/column,
      Only the blocks that are within the range of the first occurring CB will
      change colors. To instigate a CC, a CB can be placed on a NeB or
      on an open CB of the same color.
  GuardBlock
      Blocks that cannot be passed through by units, or be CC'd. It will also
      prevent a CC from occurring if in the path between CBs of the same color.
      They can be placed on any NeB, or the player's own CBs
  TrueNeutralBlock (TNB)
      These blocks cannot be CC'd and will prevent a CC like a GuardBlock,
      but they can be passed by units of both sides
  DeadBlock
      Blocks on the screen that cannot be interacted with.
      They cannot be CC'd, GuardBlocks cannot be placed there, and so forth
  ObjectiveBlock (ObjB)
      The blocks that needs to be captured to win. GuardBlocks cannot be placed on it.
      It cannot be CC'd. To capture an ObjB, an opposing unit be adjacent to it
      Can either be turned into a DeadBlock, or change to opponents color
  SpawnBlock (SB)
      Units are produced here at the start of a turn. If a unit already exists
      on the SB, a new unit will not be created. They cannot be CC'd.
      They will prevent CC's like a GuardBlock.

  Unit
      Objects that can move along blocks of their own color. They are used to
      capture the goal. Units can move any number of spaces in one direction per turn
      They are destroyed if on a block that is CC'd to an opposing color
      They can choose to self-destruct as well
      Fighter - These can destroy adjacent units (including allies)
      Paver - Can convert one NeB or unoccupied CB into their color
      Cleaner - Can convert an unoccupied CB into a NeB
      Shooter - Convert Neb or unoccupied CB into their color from a range
      Shield - Protect adjacent units from being destroyed.
